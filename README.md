I am born in 2005 in Brooklyn. I had been growing up in Brooklyn for most of my life. My favorite subject in school is science and it always had been. I am interested in learning about the things around especially the science behind them. My hobbies are playing chess, listening to music, taking a walk, and watching TV. These things really help me calm down and make me feel relaxed.

Pd 5: Big History
